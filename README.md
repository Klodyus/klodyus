# Hi there 

I am Oguz,

Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning Algorithms, Machine Learning Operations and Cloud Computing.

I had Electronic Engineering Bachelor degree from Istanbul, Turkey and Artificial Intelligence Master Degree from London, UK.
While I have more hardware programming backround such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Xilinx basys3 and Zybo, 
I decided to work on software development and artificial intelligence applications. 

In this GitHub profile, I am planning to share my own projects and learning progress.
